# Vector Algebra

## Overview
This program calculates a point **B** at a given distance from a known point **A** in 3D space.  
It supports two methods:
1. **Using a given direction vector**  
2. **Using a given slope (in degrees)**  

## Features
- Computes point **B** given an initial point **A** and a distance.
- Supports input via a **direction vector** or a **slope**.
- Implements **vector normalization** to ensure correct scaling.
